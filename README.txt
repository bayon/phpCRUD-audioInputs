This version is closer to the exact directions, and 
slightly more intuitive for the user in the way 
it handles the action buttons.


Bayon: Thanks, yes, Nancy had mentioned you were moving back.   Do you mind doing a simple 6 hour programming task as part of an extended interview (similar to what we gave you in the interview)?  You can do it at home, then send us the solution.  Below is the task.  If you are interested, then let me know.  The task is at the bottom of this email.  Once you are done, we will create a simple SFTP site for you to upload the solution.
 
Let me know if you are up to the challenge,
Tom
 
 
Task
Create a single page php application that captures the first name and last name of a person.  Keep it simple.  Styling is not needed.  This is all about function, not form. 
 
Using HTML, PHP and MySQL, write a program with the following specs:
 
A.      Create a MySQL table to hold first and last names of people.
B.      Create a web-based application with a form at the top for adding people.
C.      Underneath the form should be all of the current records in the table, with the ability to edit or delete people.
D.      When you submit a person in the form, that person should show up in the list underneath the form.
E.       When you click to edit a person from the list underneath, their name should show up in the form at the top, allowing you to then edit/save those changes, and on save the changed name should show up in the list below.
F.       When you click to delete a person, that person should show up in the form at the top, with a Confirm Delete button.  Basically, you say you want to delete the person, that person comes up into the form, then it asks if you really, really want to delete the person.
 
What I am looking for is a simple PHP page, with a form at the top to add, edit and delete people, with a list of all of the people underneath.  No javascript, just pure PHP, MySQL and HTML.
